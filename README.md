## End-to-End Big Data Analytics Pipeline for Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis**

### **1. Objective**

The objective of this project was to design, implement, and deploy an end-to-end Big Data analytics pipeline. This system automates the ingestion, processing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale e-commerce review data, leveraging modern data engineering tools including Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Hugging Face AI models.

---

### **2. Pipeline Architecture & Technology Stack**

The pipeline was designed as a scalable, automated batch-processing system.

#### **2.1. Pipeline Flowchart (DAG)**
The logical flow of data is as follows:



`Kaggle (Dataset)` $\rightarrow$ `Google Cloud Storage (Raw Data Lake)` $\rightarrow$ `Airflow / gsutil (Staging)` $\rightarrow$ `Apache Spark (Process & Analyze)` $\rightarrow$ `GCS (Processed Results)` $\rightarrow$ `Google BigQuery (Data Warehouse)` $\rightarrow$ `Looker Studio (Visualization)`

#### **2.2. Technology Stack**
* **Data Source:** Kaggle (Amazon Review Polarity Dataset)
* **Data Lake:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* **Processing:** Apache Spark (PySpark)
* **AI/ML:** Hugging Face `transformers` (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`)
* **Data Warehouse:** Google BigQuery
* **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow (via Docker Compose)
* **Visualization:** Google Looker Studio

### **3. Implementation & Execution**

#### **Part A: Data Ingestion**
1.  **Dataset:** The **"Amazon Review Polarity"** dataset from Kaggle was selected. It contains 4,000,000 records (3,600,000 training, 400,000 test), easily meeting the "> 1 million records" requirement.
2.  **Loading:** The data was batch-loaded using Apache Spark.
3.  **Data Lake:** The raw `train.csv` and `test.csv` files were uploaded and stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket (`big-data-project-taha`), which serves as our central data lake.

#### **Part B: Data Processing & Transformation**
1.  **Cleaning:** A PySpark batch job was used to read the raw CSVs. This job performed the following transformations:
    * Combined the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files into a single DataFrame.
    * Dropped any rows with null values in the `text` or `polarity` columns.
    * Normalized the review text by converting it to lowercase.
    * Cleaned the text by using `regexp_replace` to remove all HTML tags (e.g., `<br>`) and special characters/punctuation.
2.  **Analytical Form:** The data was transformed into a clean, flat table (fact table) ready for AI analysis, containing the original `polarity`, `title`, and the new `text_clean` column.

#### **Part C: AI/ML Integration (Hugging Face)**
1.  **Model:** The pre-trained Hugging Face model **`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`** was used for sentiment analysis.
2.  **Inference:** Model inference was integrated directly into the Spark pipeline using a **Pandas UDF (User-Defined Function)**. This allowed the AI model to be applied in a distributed manner across the Spark cluster, dramatically improving performance.
3.  **Storage:** The final DataFrame—containing the original polarity, the clean text, and the new AI-generated `sentiment_hf` label (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)—was written as Parquet files and then loaded into a permanent Google BigQuery table: **`amazon_reviews.review_sentiments`**.

#### **Part D: Orchestration & Automation**
1.  **DAG Creation:** An **Apache Airflow DAG** (`big_data_assignment_pipeline`) was created to fully automate the end-to-end workflow. The DAG uses a single `BashOperator` to execute the entire sequence of tasks.
2.  **Workflow:**
    * **Task 1: Authenticate:** Activates the Google Cloud service account.
    * **Task 2: Ingest:** Copies raw data from GCS (`gsutil cp`) to the local Airflow worker for processing.
    * **Task 3: Process:** Executes the PySpark script (`python3 /tmp/run_spark.py`) to perform all cleaning and AI analysis, saving the results locally.
    * **Task 4: Upload:** Copies the processed Parquet files back to GCS (`gsutil cp`).
    * **Task 5: Load:** Uses the BigQuery CLI (`bq load`) to load the Parquet files from GCS into the final BigQuery table.
3.  **Automation:**
    * **Scheduling:** The DAG is scheduled to run daily using `schedule_interval="@daily"`.
    * **Resiliency:** The DAG is configured with `retries: 1` and a `retry_delay` of 5 minutes, ensuring it automatically retries once upon a temporary failure.
    * **Logging:** All logs from every step are automatically captured by Airflow and are viewable in the web UI for monitoring and debugging.

### **4. Part E: Visualization & Insights**

The final `review_sentiments` table in BigQuery was connected to a Looker Studio dashboard to derive key insights.

* **Insight 1: Overall Sentiment is Overwhelmingly Positive**
    A sample of 100,000 reviews was analyzed. The AI model classified approximately 88.5% of reviews as 'POSITIVE' and 11.5% as 'NEGATIVE'. This suggests a high level of overall customer satisfaction in the dataset.
    

* **Insight 2: High AI Model Accuracy**
    A confusion matrix was created to compare the original dataset's label (`polarity`) with the AI's new label (`sentiment_hf`). The model demonstrated high accuracy, correctly classifying ~95.2% of the reviews, confirming the validity of our analysis.
    

* **Insight 3: Common Themes in Negative Reviews**
    By filtering the dashboard for 'NEGATIVE' reviews, common themes emerged. The most frequent negative reviews included titles like "Disappointed," "Not what I expected," and "Buyer beware," indicating issues with product quality and expectation mismatch.

### **5. Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates a robust, scalable, and fully automated Big Data pipeline. By integrating Apache Airflow for orchestration, Apache Spark for processing, and Hugging Face for advanced AI analysis, we were able to transform 4 million raw reviews from a data lake (GCS) into actionable insights in a data warehouse (BigQuery), which were then presented in a business-facing dashboard.
